Page 50 seems to be the maximum. About 20 per page. In the ideal world, 1000 per request.

There are several parameters available, such as the number of bedrooms, bathrooms, and parking spaces.
When using 5 in any options, it is actually 5-any in the url, not 5.

There are also extra features such as the presence of a swimming pool, a garden/courtyard etc.
swimmingpool, airconditioning, internallaundry, petsallowed, builtinwardrobes, gardencourtyard, study, gas, balconydeck

There are several channels like realestate.com.au, Buy, Rent, and Sold.
There are property types too, House, Apartment, Townhouse, and Land, each with sub-types, such as Terrace or Duplex.

An important one might be the parameter 'excludepricewithheld=1' which only shows houses with the sale price.

Another important parameter might be 'ssubs=0', which excludes surrounding suburbs.

For example, sold houses with 3+ bedrooms, 3+ bathrooms, 2+ parking spaces, and a swimming pool in Mill Park, Vic, 3082 would be:
https://www.domain.com.au/sold-listings/mill-park-vic-3082/house/?bedrooms=3-any&bathrooms=3-any&excludepricewithheld=1&carspaces=2-any&ssubs=0&features=swimmingpool

Furthermore, you can go for exact values of bedrooms, bathrooms, and parking spaces using:
https://www.domain.com.au/sold-listings/mill-park-vic-3082/house/3-bedrooms/?bathrooms=3-any&excludepricewithheld=1&carspaces=2-any&ssubs=0&features=swimmingpool
https://www.domain.com.au/sold-listings/mill-park-vic-3082/house/3-bedrooms/?bathrooms=3&excludepricewithheld=1&ssubs=0&features=swimmingpool

Making 3-any to 3 on ?bathrooms makes it exact. The same can be done for parking spaces.

Per page, the listings are <li>s and have the class 'css-1qp9106'
Consider the sample <li> in 'sample_li.html'.

The price is within a <div> with data-testid='listing-card-price-wrapper' and class='css-9hd67m'.
Within that div, there is a <p> with class='css-mgq8yx' and data-testid='listing-card-price'.
<div class="css-9hd67m" data-testid="listing-card-price-wrapper">
    <p data-testid="listing-card-price" class="css-mgq8yx">$3,505,000 </p>
    ...
</div>

The address spans two lines, one for the number and street, and the other for the suburb, state, and postcode.
To make it easier, use the <h2> element with class="css-bqbbuf" and data-testid="address-wrapper".
These are within <spans>s and with class='css-iqrvhs' and data-testid="address-line1" and data-testid="address-line2"
    <span data-testid="address-line1" class="css-iqrvhs">836 Moorooduc Highway,&nbsp;</span><span data-testid="address-line2" class="css-iqrvhs"><span>MORNINGTON</span> <span>VIC</span> <span>3931</span></span>
836 Moorooduc Highway,&nbsp;
<span>MORNINGTON</span> <span>VIC</span> <span>3931</span>

The property features are within a <div> with class="css-1t41ar7" and data-testid="listing-card-features-wrapper".
This has another <div> within it with class="css-k1qq7e" and data-testid="property-feature".
Once again, there is another <div> with class="css-18biwo" and data-testid="property-features-wrapper", and this has 4 <span>s.
One for the number of bedrooms, bathrooms, parking spaces, and land size.
These <spans>s have class="css-1ie6g1l" and data-testid="property-features-feature".
The actual text is contained within another <span> with class="css-lvv8is" and data-testid="property-features-text-container".
The span next to this (which states what type of data it is has class="css-9fxapx" and data-testid="property-features-text".
The spans with "property-features-text" can be: 'Beds', 'Baths', 'Parking', and the land size. The land size has no discernable feature, although it is
always the fourth one. Some houses do not have any features.

The property type can be found in the <div> with class="css-11n8uyu". Within that div, there is a <span> with class="css-693528".
For houses, this should say 'House'.

The sold at auction is a <span> with class="css-1nj9ymt".
