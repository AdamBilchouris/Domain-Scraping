Looking at the listing for an individual house, some information is already available on the page the link was from (the search page).

One important section of this is the 'Property Features' page. This has some features such as 'Secure Parking', 'Air conditioning', 'Heating', and so on.
This can influence the house price.

Further down, there is a section for how many schools there are, and how far away they are. It has Government schools, as well as
independent schools. It has how far away they are from the house in kilometers.

The property features are in a <div> with id="property-features", class="css-1v0nat1", name="property-features", data-testid="listing-details__additional-features".
Each feature is in a <ul> with class="css-4ewd2m". The are <li>s with the property feature.
They have class="css-vajaaq" and data-testid="listing-details__additional-features-listing" for a true feature of the house, and
data-testid="listing-details__additional-features-suggested" for ones that are predicted for the house based off the description.

For the schools, not all schools are show as they are only added by pressing a JS button. This might mean Selenium might have to be used.
The <button> to show more shcools has class="css-cq4evq", data-testid="fe-co-school-catchment-view-more-link", aria-label="View more All schools".

This URL can be found through the URL member variable of the Property object.

Maybe look only at schools within 5km?
